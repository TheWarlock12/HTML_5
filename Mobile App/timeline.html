                The Age of StarbirthEdit

The Age of Starbirth is the first of the ages of Krynn, and is said to begin with the High God. The High God accepts the offers of Paladine, Gilean, and Takhisis and lets the three gods select their companion deities. Paladine and his companions become the Gods of Light. Takhisis and her companions become the Gods of Darkness. Gilean and his companions become the Gods of Balance. Reorx shapes Krynn and the first dragons under the guidance of Paladine and Takhisis. The other gods, excluding Chaos, aid in the creation of Krynn as a habitable world.

Takhisis corrupts the first dragons in her image, creating the first chromatic dragons: red, blue, black, green, and white. A grief-stricken Paladine asks Reorx to craft monuments to his lost children. Paladine gives life to these monuments, thus creating the first metallic dragons: gold, silver, copper, bronze, and brass. Takhisis's treachery causes a great war on Krynn known as the All-Dragons War. The gods withdraw from Krynn before their war destroys the world. The Gods of Light build the Dome of Creation, the Gods of Darkness create the Abyss, and the Gods of Balance create the Hidden Vale.

The three pantheons discover the potential of the stars, which are spirits in reality, and the All-Saints War begins. The fighting is stopped by the High God, who proclaims that each pantheon may offer one gift to the spirits. The gods of Light provide the spirits with physical forms so as to enjoy Krynn's pleasures. The gods of Darkness "gift" the spirits with ambition and desire. The gods of Balance give free will to the spirits. The spirits are born into the world of Krynn as the races of ogres, elves, and humans. Each family of gods creates one god to honor the truce, and the Gods of Magic are born: good Solinari, neutral Lunitari, and evil Nuitari.

Reorx is persuaded to craft a powerful gemstone that will contain the essence of neutrality. Reorx tries to infuse the gem with a portion of Chaos, but entraps the god himself. Reorx gives the gem to Lunitari, who puts it in the red moon that shares her name. The gemstone becomes known as the Graygem.
The Age of DreamsEdit

The second age or Age of Dreams is often considered the beginning of recorded history, and runs c. 9000 PC – c. 1000 PC.

c. 6000 PC As ogres embrace cruelty, humans rise up to slay their masters. Ogre civilization slowly decays. Ogres deform into strong brutes. Giants, goblins, half-ogres, and ogre mages become more widespread.

1905 PC Quivalin XI, a relative to the previous emperors, manages to seize the throne after decades of succession disputes.

1900 PC Quivalin XI, twenty-seventh emperor, Ergoth, attempts to change the rule of succession so that only blood-relatives of the Quivalin line who are also members of the Conclave of High Sorcery can ascend to the throne.

On his deathbed, Kith-Kanan names Silveran as his successor while at the same time decreeing that Ulvian be let go despite his dark deeds.
