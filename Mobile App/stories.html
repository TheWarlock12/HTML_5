                THE TALE OF SILVER AND PLAGUE
Book 1
A Life is Spared
          Argento and his band of adventurers were surrounded. Monsters of the Blight had formed a circle in which they were trapped. The Silver Prince had lost, there was no hope. “It was an honor fighting with you my friends. For honor and for glory!” The forsaken adventurers charged.
Four havsons earlier, (5 ½ months)
Argento was the prince of Animathacar. A kingdom bordered by a long chain of mountains and adjacent to the inland lake Sukilatha. It was by far the largest kingdom of humans anywhere on Volvindargen. His brother, Nedak, was one of the greatest sorcerers in all of the land. However, Nedak’s face was horribly disfigured and his legs were useless. He had to be carried or wheeled about in a stiff chair. By birthright, Nedak was to be ruler over Animathacar. His condition however was one that no healer, medicine woman, or wizard could repair. So, while he spent his days in the confines of his tower, studying the mystical wonders and powers of magic, Argento, the second son learned to be king. Argento was a tall man, fair skinned, silver haired, with bright golden eyes. He was the most loved by the people of the royal family.
          While Argento grew in stature and fame, Nedak grew in power. He was gifted, blessed with the rare affinity for many kinds of magic. Creotion (the magic of forming objects from energy), Sanation (the magic of healing), Agereation (the magic to move), and more. He blessed the kingdom with his magic, enchanting the weather to rain in drought and water the fields, and a health that kept the sickness at bay. But he was vain. He resented the way people looked at him. The sorcerer was the heart of stories told to scare children, he was the gossip, he was the shadow that followed a lonely walker in the night. He wanted to change, to have a body like normal people. So, when the light seemed to fail him, he walked into the dark. One night, he and a set of his trusted guardsmen fled the castle in the witching hour. On horses they rode all throughout the night. Then in time, they found the witches of the swamp Cedur. There he studied in the tutelage of hags. They promised they could change him, and change him they did. A havson passed and when Nedak returned to Animathacar his body was whole, Argento was overjoyed that his brother had returned, but he could see an evil that surrounded him. Nedak was dark, as if the light was absorbed by him. He quickly went into his tower and barred the door. Sealing himself from the world. The enchanted rain that fed the fields ceased to fall and the aura of health that filled the kingdom vanished. The darkness grew. Ominous clouds filled the sky, blocking the sun and turning the land from green, to grey. When Argento went to confront his brother about the disturbances, he found the tower sealed. Afraid that he would do something foolish, Argento ordered the door to be broken down, but to no avail. It was sealed by magic. The witches had turned his brother to their evil ways.
          That night powerful tension filled the air, and a blast of magic radiated from Nedak’s tower. All the kingdom felt the shockwave of power. Then the Blight came. It spread slowly, only an arms breadth a day. Wherever the curse touched plants, they began to wither, and turn to ash. Every thirteen days after, a new symptom of the Blight appeared. Food would turn to rot and become rancid, aged would give up the ghost, the land turned black, and water became sour. Argento pleaded for days at the door of Nedak to stop this evil curse. In the middle of the night, a roc, a magnificent and gargantuan bird came, broke down the walls of the castle, and captured the Silver Prince. In the turmoil Argento was struck in the head and fell unconscious. The bird brought the stolen heir to Nedak, for he had summoned the creature. “So pure, so pathetic, drown him in the lake.” Right before the roc took flight, the evil wizard cast a bolt of magic at his brother’s head. “Just in case he puts up a fight,” Nedak muttered, and the beast took to the air. The roc went on its journey, but as soon as it was out of the kingdom a powerful voice entered into the beast’s mind. It called the creature to the mountains far, far south. The bird flew long and far but the voice gave it strength. In three days, the creature saw lush green forests. The clouds were thick and it smelled of rain. The roc gently laid him outside a small lodge on the mountains top and flew back to its home.
          From the lodge came an old bent woman and a youthful girl. The girl ran strait ways and gathered her grey skinned beasts of the jungle. The beasts, gently lifted Argento into the lodge with their long and wrinkled snouts. The woman shuffled inside and began to treat her new patient, unaware of his origin.
Book 2
The Master and the Apprentice
          For a day the master and the apprentice watched and tended to the stranger with silver hair, who could only have been brought by the Archons, for no roc would willingly waste the flesh of man. In the day nothing seemed to happen but, by the moon’s light he healed rapidly. The woman fed him a potion that she had concocted to help him. As they waited the master continued to tutor her apprentice. They studied plants, how they healed, how they nourished, and how they hurt. They learned everything about the animals of the jungle. Their feeding habits, breeding rituals, and the properties of all their parts. With the knowledge the apprentice had learned over the years from her master and her own studies the apprentice became an expert naturalist and potion brewer.
           Then one balmy and humid afternoon while the master and apprentice were working their garden, the young girl spotted the stranger with silver hair. He came to the doorway of the hut, peeking out with his golden eyes blinking furiously in the bright jungle sunlight. She quickly jumped up from her work and ran to him as he staggered out. As the stranger was about to step outside, he collapsed just as the apprentice reached him and she caught the man in her arms. Her master shuffled over and helped them bring the stranger back inside to lie down. “Who are you?” the stranger asked. The apprentice answered, “I am Eidas, and this is Llebasi we live here, what is your name?” “I’m not sure,” he replied, “I hoped that you might know who I am.” Soon-with Eidas and Llebasi by his side-he fell into a deep slumber.
Later Eidas and Llebasi talked by the crackling hearth discussing the strange identity lost man. “I feel something strange grandmother,” Eidas said, “something tells me I need to follow this man. He is where my future lies.” As they talked, the stranger with silver hair dreamed. He dreamed he was surrounded by fog, and felt that no matter how long he walked he never went anywhere. Then he heard the flapping of wings and a raven slowly descending, circled round him in the air. When it touched the ground, a clearing in the fog opened up, centered on the bird. The man with golden eyes felt, he needed to touch the beautiful avian. He slowly crept up to it, but it trotted away. Then he started to run, and it took to the air. If only he touched that raven, he would know, he would be able to see what lay around him that he was blind to. For hours it seemed he ran, the bird always just out of reach. Then the raven dived and the man felt the ground give way. He fought nausea as he reached and stretched for the bird and fell in the air. Just before he hit the bottom, his finger brushed a feather.
The stranger suddenly bolted upright, sweat pouring down his face and heard a scream. He saw Llebasi next to an open window, a hand to her heart while Eidas was knelt down next to him. “You about gave us a heart attack!” Eidas scolded. “I opened a window because it was getting hot in here and you were sweating so badly,” said Llebasi, “but as soon as the moonlight touched you, you sat up so fast that it scared us so much I was sure death would come knocking!”
The man was about to answer when he heard a voice whisper, “Argento, remember.” Then he remembered. He remembered who he was, Argento the Pure. The Silver Prince of Animathacar. Then he remembered how his brother had turned to the darkness, and he felt that he had been spared to stop Nedak. As Argento told Eidas and Llebasi what he remembered, he became increasingly certain that the Archons had chosen him to stop his brother. The longer he waited the more powerful Nedak would grow and the larger his reign of Blight.
For the rest of the night the trio talked, discussed and made plans. In the morning they made preparation for Argento to leave. They wrapped food in leaf packages, and clean water in skins. As the sun reached mid-morning, the master and the apprentice were about to see the Silver Prince set off into the jungle, continuing his quest, but Eidas grabbed his arm and said, “I have to come with you.”
Book 3
Rescue
           “The wilderness is no place for a young woman!” Argento said reverting to his ingrained sense of chivalry. Eidas just made that face that only a girl can make and said, “If you haven’t noticed your highness, but I live in the middle of it! Maybe you should get off your high and royal horse and get some dirt on your nose.” Argento took a deep breath, and apologized, “I’m sorry my lady, it would be my greatest honor for you to accompany me on my journey through the sweltering forest.” Eidas turned to look at her grandmother, Llebasi nodded and said, “You are ready, but these old bones will not see me through a journey the likes of that. Go and grab your things.” While Eidas ran back to the lodge to grab her meager possessions, Llebasi went to the garden and started to dig. “Come help a poor old woman Argento.” Realizing he was just standing there, Argento jumped and rushed over to help. What a sight it must have been for Eidas to see them pawing at the dirt like hounds.
    The old sage pulled a small wooden box from the earth and gingerly handed it to Eidas. “This will explain everything” she said, “everything you do not know.” The master and the apprentice tenderly embraced and with tearful eyes they parted. As Eidas began to walk down the mountain Llebasi stood at the top and waved until her precious granddaughter was out of sight.
--------
So, the two questers trekked down the mountain with a map to guide them to the nearby settlement, Lsid. While they walked Eidas would gather plants to aid them: food, healing herbs, insect deterrents. Her vast knowledge made the journey much easier. They followed a path down the mountain, but when they reached the bottom of the cliff, the path disappeared into the undergrowth. “Well, what now?” Eidas asked. Argento brought a clenched hand, which began to glow, close to his mouth and blew pushing the shimmering energy outward. The energy condensed, pouring out of his hand into the shape of a longsword. Eidas starred with wondrous eyes as she saw magic first hand. The conjuration looked the exact same as a longsword except for being blue and slightly transparent. Looking tired Argento grabbed the floating sword out of the air and swung it, shearing through the thick and twisted vines. Argento smiled at Eidas, bowed, and began to clear a path through the sweltering undergrowth.
The two adventurers traveled through the twisted vines and gnarled branches till they reached a small clearing and made camp. Argento got a fire going with some stones, his sword vanished into the air, while Eidas prepared a package of food that Llebasi had given them. The sun was just sitting on the horizon when a slight breeze blew through the camp. On the wind was the sweetest smell that Eidas and Argento had ever sniffed before. “I have to find that delicious smell! Come with me, let us search for it together.” Argento said, offering a hand to Eidas as he stood. She stood up and replied, “Race you to it.” And they were off, following the wind.
The duo ran for about two minutes before they reached the new clearing, Argento just behind Eidas. This one was large and almost circular. In the middle was a cluster of three green trunks with few leaves on them. These trees each had a single yellow fruit dangling from their tops. This must be were that sweet smell was coming from. “Argento, give me a boost, your stronger than I am.” So, Eidas climbed up onto Argento’s shoulders, gripping the scaly bark for support as they reached. Suddenly the ground quaked, the duo toppled to the earth and the trees started to shake. A trunk opened its eye and looked straight at the adventurers. The trunks were necks and from the soil burst the legs of a beast. Argento tried to summon his sword, but was magically exhausted from the journey. Eidas gripped his arm as they stared down their doom.
    Out of the forest flew an arrow that pierced one of the heads through both of its eyes. The serpentine head hissed, shaking the ground and writhing in pain. The two heads looked to where the arrow had come. Then a graceful warrior arching out of the trees and swung a long staff and placed a shattering blow on a hydra head. It instantly fell to the earth, limp and wide eyed as if it was surprised it could die. The last head was taken by another arrow from the shadowed boughs. The shot was so powerful that it punctured the skull. The hydra’s giant body fell as the last of its heads was slain. The fall shook the earth, frightening the birds take flight.
    The warrior was clothed in all manner of skins and furs. An obsidian dagger at her hip, and shillelagh in her hand. Her skin was a light tan from the jungle sun, while dark eyes stared at the two questers. She walked over to them and raised a hand, palm facing them. “Hello,” she said. Argento scrambled to his feet and pulled Eidas up. He raised his hand in the same fashion, “Hello to you as well,” he said. From the trees swung down the second warrior. She was much shorter than the first and carried a bow in hand and a similar blade on her waist.  The shorter warrior one spoke to the first in a language that Eidas and Argento didn’t understand. She went over to the hydra corpse and began to cut the beast with her obsidian blade. The tall warrior turned back to Argento saying, “Come, help?” kneeling next to her friend.
    Argento was confused, who were these people, why did they save him and Eidas? “What is your name?” he asked the tall warrior, he put a hand on his chest, “I am Argento, she” he points to Eidas, “is Eidas.” “Ahhh,” says the warrior, “You Argento, she Eidas, me, Eilnyrb, she Yram.” Eilnryb pointed to the short warrior, then motioned to the hydra, “Help cut? Help carry?” Argento shrugged his shoulders and went to get leaves to package the bloody mess.  Eidas had harvested many animals before and knew a little about what hydra parts should be used. Pulling out her small iron dagger she started to process the beast. The women harvested the eyes, tongues, teeth, venom glands and the eggs of the beast that were being incubated in its belly. Argento carried meat, as to not waste. Eidas the tongues and teeth, Yram the eggs, and Eilnryb the venom and eyes. Then they walked. For eight miles they carried these precious parts. Through the mug of the jungle and the thick of the undergrowth until Argento could take no more and sat on the ground. “Close,” Eilnryb said, “just over there.” Eidas offered a hand and Argento stood. They walked only for eight meters more, when they stopped.  
Now the party had come to a grove of giant trees, whose trunks seemed to hold up the sky. Their branches stretched far and wide, their shadow spanned the space of a city. Yram put down the delicate eggs, and yelled at the trees. Her yell sounded like the call of a black tipped yrad (predatory bird). A platform fell out of the boughs. A hundred feet it fell, till it slowed and stopped, Yram carefully gathered the eggs and sat down on the platform. Eilnryb jumped on grabbing a rope, “You come too?” she asked. Argento and Eidas conversed, “We got this far, they rescued us, maybe they can help.” They got on and sat down. Eilnryb tugged on the rope. Two pulls, and they were slowly raised up. Higher and higher, then when they passed the lowest branches, the witnessed the most beautiful thing they had ever seen.
Book 4
Queen of the Saltu
Argento and Eidas stared. The bird was gorgeous, its rainbow feathers shimmered with a metallic sheen. Scarlet and orange wings beat the thick jungle air, a lovely song burst from its golden beak, its lustrous tail feathers showed the truest azure blue, and emerald green. The bird took flight, gracefully soaring farther into the tree tops. “Its beautiful,” Argento whispered. Eilnryb nodded in agreement, “very preety.” Their platform continued to rise. The branches of the great trees were thick like roads and flowed like rivers. A house? No, an entire village filled the branches of the great trees. Platforms held dwellings, people dashed about on various errands. Eidas and Argento were in awe, a city in the trees.
The platform came to a stop and the group picked themselves up. Eilnyrb and Yram were greeted by similar looking tribesmen who had heard of their return. Tan skinned, black haired, dark eyed. A man at the head was wearing an elaborate circlet made of brass and jade. When Eilnyrb showed the lead man her prize, the group quickly ushered the two warriors away, leaving the Argento and Eidas awkwardly standing. Two women came to up to the platform where they stood and took their arms, leading them down the branches of the tree. They walked down stairs and paths had been cut into the branches. Argento noticed that some of the trunks had been hollowed out to make homes. A group of men were using obsidian hatchets to carve, what looked like a silo, into a large branch that was standing almost vertical. These people were brilliantly advanced. Aquifers filled wells, which were lined in clay. A symbiotic relationship existed here. The trees provided almost everything the people needed: shelter, water, air. And the people kept the trees healthy by fertilizing, pruning, and protecting.
These people were not known in any book that Argento knew about. They had lain here hidden in the jungle for hundreds, if not a thousand years. The women at Argento’s and Eidas’s arms continued to guide them down the branch and to the central trunk. They stopped at a hollowed out room and ushered the two inside. A circular table was in the middle of the room, low to the ground. At the head sat Eilnryb who was curiously conversing with many men and women. She was wearing the circlet of brass and jade. Argento and Eidas couldn’t understand what they were saying, but when Eilnryb saw them, a wide smile came upon her face. She excitedly began to speak to the elders in the room. Then they also began to talk excitedly. Some villagers brought bowls of fruit to the duo, who graciously accepted and ate. After a few minutes of Argento and Eidas listening to this foreign chatter and feasting on the fruit, Eilnyrb called an end to the meeting. The many wise men and women quietly and respectfully filed out of the room.
Eilnryb stood and took Argento and Eidas by the arms. They strode out of the room and walked. Argento was brimming with questions: how did you know where they were, who are you Eilnryb, what is this place? As they walked they saw children nimbly playing on the great branches of the trees. Bridges and cut out stairs connected the village. Rooms were hollowed out of the trunks or branches and houses were built in the Y’s of the branches. It was all so complex, yet beautifully simple. As the two questers walked they talked with Eilnryb. They were surprised to find out she was the Chief of this village, her husband took care of it while she was out on expeditions. She had learned the Anim language (that Argento and Eidas spoke) from explorers that stayed with them in their treetop village long ago. Argento told her about his brother’s betrayal, scheme, and the dream he had when he was with Llabasi. Then Eilnryb told them of a dream that she had. In that dream, she was in a clearing, hydra tree at the center and she saw Argento and Eidas about to touch it’s bark. She was frightened because of the danger that she knew await there. When she woke up she received a feeling of the direction she needed to take. She called Yram to attend her, then they set off and reached the two of them in the nick of time.
Again they thanked Eilnryb, but now they had more pressing matters. “Eilnryb, we thank you for the great hospitality and kindness, but we must be on our way to stop my brother from overtaking the kingdom, possibly all of Volvindargen, do you know of a way for us to get their faster? Walking will take us much too long to arrive.” said Argento. Eilnryb replied, “Not far, the Mutalk marsh, standing circle to move far, yes? Go from there to great village. I come with, hags guard, you need help, come I have gift.” She rushed off, leading Argento and Eidas to a large room, covered in baked clay. It was a forge! A large and muscular man was working a red-hot piece of metal, an apprentice helped him. “Argento, this be Nitsua our, umm, sword maker.” Nitsua nodded to Argento and went back to work. Eilnryb grabbed a shining iron sword off the rack and presented it to Argento who said, “I am greatly honored by this gift Eilnryb, but I already have a sword.” He gave it to Eidas, “The path of the blade is not one to be taken lightly. If you would allow Eidas, I would be honored to teach it to thee.” She smirked, testing its balance. “Sure, I mean, yes your highness. It would be good to finally know how to cut open other people.” “Well then,” said Argento “Eilnryb, if you don’t mind, let us rest a day before we continue. For we are greatly exhausted from our labors.” Eilnryb then led them to an empty hollow, padded by exotic animal skins. And there, they slept, for the dawn would be the beginning of a great and terrible day.
Book 5
Powers Unfolded
    Argento and Eidas awakened to the glorious song of the amozakoc bird that they had seen earlier. Yram stood by the door of the hut. On her shoulder perched the beautiful bird they had seen yesterday. It still was colored like a magnificent rainbow. Eilnryb was accompanying the short warrioress.
“Rest good?” asked Eilnryb “Time to go, sun tells time is good.”
“Best in ages, “ replied Eidas.
Argento said, “Nothing beats a bed, but that was great.” They collected their belongings, Eidas hooked her new sword on her belt and swung a bag over her shoulder, while Argento shouldered his pack.
“Where your sword? Argento” asked Eilnryb.
“Well, I don’t need a sword you see, here, let me just show you.” Argento held out his hands like he was gripping a sword, magical energy flowed out of him like mist, then condensing formed a blade of pure magic. The blue and slightly translucent conjuration greatly surprised Eilnryb and Yram. They took one look at each other and grabbed him by the arms, running down the great branches of the tree. Eidas let out a sigh, and ran nimbly after him. The group ran up stairs carved into the trunk of the tree nearing the top boughs. There they stopped at a great circle, that sat in the center. Symbols and runes were burned into the circle, and in the center, was a dias made out of wood. In the dais, a slot where a sword could fit.
“Here, long time ago, stories say Vinigorn grew this, only a conjurer could take what was inside, he would end an end.” said Eilnryb, “Argento this be you. Take the sword, take the prize, for you this is.”
Argento tried to summon his sword again, but he was magically exhausted. “I can’t, there isn’t enough magic left. “
“Try, try, harder!” replied Eilnryb.
“Come on Argento, you can do it!” said Eidas.
Argento reached inside and grabbed what was left, condensing the magic into a dagger and stabbed the wood.
    There was a crack, like the sound of thunder, and the dias split in half. A cloud of smoke rose from the cavity and inside was a dazzling silver circlet set with lapis stones. It had been crafted to look like a wreath of leaves, the species was unfamiliar. Argento gently pulled the artifact from the crevice. It glowed with a pale light. He placed it on his head and felt a surge of power. No longer did his reservoir of magic feel restricted. Argento laughed triumphantly and summoned a sword. In an instant it was there. He tried a different weapon, a bow this time, with arrows. The magic flowed through his hands condensing into a sleek bow. He pulled the drawstring, an arrow formed, and fired. The spectral arrow zoomed through the air. This power was exhilarating. “Thank you, Eilnryb and Yram. You would not believe how great this feels, to no longer be constricted by my small reservoir of power.”
    “Anything else you want to tell us? Did the prophecy say anything about a young girl?” asked Eidas.
    “No more.” replied Eilnryb.
    They descended the tree, Argento almost giddy. He would form anything that would come to his mind. They had reached the ground and were starting to walk when Argento got an idea. He stopped and the girls hesitated in their march, what in the world was he doing? No way that the prince was already tired.
“If I can just remember how he did it.” Argento whispered. Then a woosh of magical energy. Each of the girls stood next to eatheral horses. They stomped and neighed excited by the magic that brought them to life.
“Yee Haa! Hop on girls.” Argento jumped on his horse and charged through the forest, whooping along the way. Eilnryb, Yram and, Eidas struggled to keep up with him and his enthusiasm as they charged off into the most sinister part of the rainforest.
Book 6
Shadows in the Haglands
    They had arrived. Argento and his company walked through the thinning trees of the forest. Before, they walked among great giants of trees, on carpets of undergrowth, and through curtains of vines. Now, as the trees diminished, the ground squished and squashed underneath as they passed short stubby trees which stood on roots that reached into the marshy ground like fingers searching for gold. Argento released his conjured horses and they faded into the mist that cloaked the weed choked ground. The cold sun seemed to cast a gloom over this forsaken land instead of giving light and warmth.
“Let us go back a little ways, the sun sets, I would prefer to not face the hags when the moon rules the night. Let us make camp.” spoke Argento. And so they did. Finding a place among the boughs of the giant trees and distanced from the haglands they slept.
-------------------------------
    Scratch, scratch. Eilnryb awoke to the noise, tapped the wood thrice, and Yram’s eyes flew open. Nodding to each other the duo, silent as snakes, rose to all fours and crept along the branches of the tree, alert for danger. Sensing nothing around it they crept back to Argento and Eidas. When they climbed back they were astonished to find constrictor snakes wrapping their coils around the panicked adventurers.
The snakes had constricted around Argento’s mouth and bound his hands so he could use no magic. Eidas was bound from mouth to calf within the tendril of a similar snake. Both were beasts had black scales with blood-red eyes. Eilnryb and Yram were about to jump into action when from the mists far below, two hags flew up behind them and snached the arms of the warriors, trying to restrain them. Eilnryb snapped her head back hitting the hag square in the nose with her head, which in turn shoved the hags nose into her brain, instantly killing her. The amozakoc bird flew into the face of the hag restraining Yram, clawing out its eyes. Then in one fluid motion Yram twisted out of the hags grip, slid her dagger out of its sheath and, plunged it into the hags heart. The hags made no sound as they fell silently into the mist below.
Meanwhile as Eilnryb and Yram fought, four other hags flew up to the branches of the tree and stole Argento and Eidas out of the reach of their friends. As they were flying away into the dark sky, one of the hags holding the Silver Prince suddenly fell out of the sky. The hag on the other end of the prince sank down the the ground gathered her snakes of the prince and flew off to join the other hags as they flew even more rapidly away. Eilnryb and Yram had just freed themselves to see Eidas carried away. A glow on the ground revealed the whereabouts of one of the nabbed adventurer.
Eilnryb and Yram rushed over to Argento. He started to stand on wobbly legs.
“We have to go get Eidas!” Argento said, “Who knows what those hags will do to her, we can make it to the portal after we grab her.” They started chasing the hags, barely visible in the moonlight. Yram released her amozakoc bird, tailing the hags. As they ran Argento regained his strength and started to formulate a plan. They ran on for the better part of an hour, following the beautiful colors of the bird. Then out of the gloom and the mist they saw a fire. Oh how great of a conflagration it was. Fifteen feet high and about ten feet wide this great fire raged. Hunched figures danced around it, chanting in an ancient tongue. The hag’s camp was set on a small hill, raised above the marsh. Snakes, bats, and cats all patrolled the area surrounding the demonic coven. The party searched for Eidas. They found her close to the bonfire bound to another prisoner. This time they were wrapped in true rope not snakes.
“Okay,” whispered Argento, “I can make a distraction with my magic, Eilnryb and Yram, try and get to Eidas and get her out of there!”  They readied themselves and Argento started whispering under his breath. A huge form began to take shape, Argento formed large body, four scaled legs, a long snake-like tail, wings like a bat, and a giant toothy maw. The dragon roared! The hags wailed and abandoned their ritual as they ran and flew away from the fire breathing beast racing towards them. Eilnryb and Yram followed close behind it’s large path of destruction trying to get close to their kidnapped friend.
The dragon nocked hags to and fro, breathing spectral flames that burned with a blue light. Argento stood on the hill with great difficulty controlling the beast. Eilnryb and Yram made it to Eidas, who was slumped over and unconscious. The man she was tied to groaned. Eilnryb spoke quickly to Yram and they each grabbed a captive and started to make their way as fast as they could back to Argento. Suddenly, another dragon roared. A black instead of blue spectral dragon appeared and challenged Argento’s creation. They clashed in a colossal battle crushing witches and rolling over the fire. Eilnryb looked around, who had summoned the challenger? Then through the flames of bonfire she saw a hag. Unlike the others, this had alluring midnight black hair that was billowing in the wind. Her grey rags clung to her pale flesh and her eyes were like ebony orbs without white or retina. She offhandedly seemed to cast and controlled her magic. Argento was however failing, soon to give way as his magic was unable to best this Dark Queen.
A red bolt flew from the shadows of the trees, striking true in the small of the hag’s back.  The grey lady fell to the ground, overthrown. Instantly her magic dissipated and Argento seemed to begin to recover. With this large nuisance taken care of, Yram and Eilnryb quickly brought the prisoners to Argento, then he created a cube of protection to surround the band as they treated Eidas and this life starved warrior.
Book 7
The Hunter’s Prey
    The life starved warrior opened his eyes. His blue-green retina seemed to be as that of crystal. Outside, lay destruction. The conjured dragon had obliterated the hags’ ritual ground. The bodies of the fallen fiends lay scattered about, their black revolting blood pooling in the muck filled wasteland, Death’s will had been carried out with great accomplishment.
    “The sleeper has awakened,” whispered Argento. Eidas, Eilnryb, and Yram all turned to look at their new companion. He opened his eyes and stared into the night. They waited for an hour, and their new companion did not stir. Eidas gave him some medicinal herbs which he gently took from her and ate. 
    “Well, I suppose since Eidas is fine now, we should quickly continue our quest.” Argento spoke, then he looked to the new man. “If you desire to join us on my quest, you are welcome to, but you are free to go where you wish.” Revoking his protective cube, Argento and the rest of the adventurers gathered their equipment that hadn’t been lost in the fight and started again, deeper into the marsh. As they walked the man followed them. Strange to them it seemed. Like a wraith haunting them from the shadows, always watching, ever silent. The trees grew larger here, their trunks rose many feet off the ground. They were coming close to the middle of the marsh, where the portal was supposed to be, when at the head of the group, Eilnryb spotted a light. Darkness was still cloaked over the haglands making the light even brighter as it lit the shadows. The adventurers hustled over to a small ridge were they could peer at the profound conundrum without revealing themselves to a potential enemy. 
“What we do Argento?” asked Eilnryb, “I look, go see if good or bad?” The leader thought for a moment then said, “Go, this place is far more dangerous than we have realized, maybe there could be someone there to help us and show us the way to the portal we seek, keep silent and to the shadows.” Eilnryb sleuthed down to the light, making the most of the scarce cover that was afforded to her. Quickly the reconnaissance was completed and she returned to the ridge where the dirty adventurers lay in the stinking mud. 
“A hut, Argento. It lies in ring made white stone. Fire gives light. Inside, woman works alone.” Eilnryb said. Pleased by the prospect of some civilization, Argento led his small band of followers down the slope. They found a ring of white marble. In it was a small shack made out of rough sawn timber standing about a foot off the ground on stilts. The roof was a mix of straw and sunbaked mud. A small garden of strange and fascinating plants filled the space between the ring of marble and the house. Argento knocked on the hut’s wooden door as his companions stood warily behind him. A noise like the cocking of a crossbow sounded behind the door as the latch jingled. The door swung slowly open and a silhouette leveled a crossbow at Argento’s chest. 
“Who in VolVinDarGen are you?” said the shadow, “What are you doing here?” Argento glanced at the brodhead of the bolt, inches from his heart. 
“We are just travelers trying to find our way though this wasteland. We thought you could help us.” Argento replied nervously. The woman lowered her crossbow. 
“You come in, the others stay out there.” Argento glanced back at his friends stepped inside, and she shut and barred the door. 
Inside the room there was a small furnace where a fire burned and Argento was able to get a good look at the hermit. She was dressed in a long leather duster and tall boots while a wide brimmed hat graced her flaming hair. Her skin was pale from the gloom of the haglands.  A small table inside was covered in strange plants and vials that were filled with pickled organs. A large book lay on the table, its pages were covered in messy handwriting and diagrams that confounded Argento. The most frightening and confusing thing that Argento beheld was the hag that sat in a chair. Sitting in an iron chair and manacled while her mouth was bound in sackcloth. Ebony eyes glared at him, like a furious darkness they seemed to envelope him. He snapped out of the trance and summoned a sword prepared to run the monstrosity through when he felt a kick in his stomach and fell to the ground as the wind was knocked out of him. 
“What in the Pits do you think that you are doing?! You got any idea how long it took for me to catch her? I’ve been out hunting this witch for fifteen years! And not till some freakish magic dragon attacked them was I able to…” The woman stopped yelling, and looked curiously at Argento. The blue sword he had summoned looked just like what the dragon was made out of. “Wait a minute, were you the one who made that dragon?” she knelt down, her face close to his. “Well,” she whispered, “I guess I should be thanking you.” She stood up, and offered Argento a hand. Which he took and stood up. “If you hadn’t made that dragon, I would never have been able to nab my sister.”

Book 8
Their Blood, Birth, and Bonds
“Sorry, I kicked you, but you can’t go around stabbing people in other people’s homes. Didn’t they teach you that, your Highness? Enna’s the name.” 
    Argento was caught off guard, “This hag is your sister? You have lived her for fifteen years? How do you know who I am?” he exclaimed. “I just met you!” 
    “Sit,” Enna replied pulling up one of the two chairs left. “I’m not one for life stories so i’ll give it to ya strait. Me and my sister were born in Animathicar. I was the oldest, and Yurabua here was the youngest.” Yurabua glared at Enna, “Yurabua was a good wizard who was accepted to the academy. A couple months there one of the students went all dark like and decided to run off with a band of his little followers, kidnapin a few students in the process. Somehow they rigged the teleportation circle there and ended up here. I’ve been trying to capture my sister since. Then you came along and distracted her long enough for me to knock her out real good. I caught her and brought her here. That iron is a special concoction of mine, she won’t be able to use magic while in that chair.” 
    “I remember when that happened. We called you the Hunter back in the castle after you swore to hunt down your sister and all those renegades. You were quite the story, but after you never came back we assumed you were killed.” Argento
“Well, I’m sure it was quite the story then, but we are in the story now and I am quite alive. I’m trying to turn her back but, It’s not like it’s easy turning someone back from hagform.”  
“Have you figured out how to do it yet?” 
“Well I have everything I need but it takes about a day to take effect. The circle is supposed to ward off the monsters of the night but if any of those hags survived your attack, they’ll be coming back to rescue their leader.” 
“Do you remember how to work the portal?”
“I can get it to work but it will take time. Once my sister has been sedated we can engage the ritual.” 
“Well, how about my party and I protect you from the hags until you activate the ritual and then we can save weeks of time trying to get back to Animathicar.”
“Okay, deal.” Enna put out her calloused hand and Argento shook it. 
“Well,” said Enna, “I’d better meet my protectors for a day.” Enna checked Yrebua’s chair and then they walked out of the ramshackle hut. Enna paused surveying her new companions. Argento stood next to her and introduced his friends. 
“Enna this is Eilnryb, Yram and this man has not spoken a word yet. But seems to be unthreatening and has joined our party.” Enna stopped, and her eyes began to moisen.
“Mankato, is it really you?” Mankato took her hand in his and carresed her cheek. Tears began to fall from his eyes as well as they tenderly embraced. “My love, oh thank Vinigorn. But why do you not speak. Did those hags cut out your tongue?!” Mankato only gave the smallest of nods. “Those fiends, I swear I will kill them all. I’ll never let them take you again, like to many before. Not like Yerbua, not like you, not like Eidas.” Eidas’s breath caught. 
“The letter said that I had a sister,” 
“What letter?” exclaimed Argento
“The one in the box from Llebasi, it told me everything, how my parents sent me away to live with her because there wasn’t enough food in Animathicar in the day’s before Nedack’s rain.” 
“Enna, I think I’m your sister.” 
“Vinigorn be praised! Come here my little Eidas, come here.” And for a little time the reunited as the affairs of the heart overcame them. The world’s end could wait just a moment more as the wife, husband, and sister all were brought together by Vinigorn’s merciful hand. 

Book 9
Til Night’s End
    “Well,” said Enna, “Let’s take care of your other sister and then we can help take out Nedak. Argento you and Mankato guard the door. Yram and Eilnryb back wall. Everyone stay inside the circle. Whatever those hags summon up is not going to like crossing those stones. Eidas you help me with Yerbua two will make it faster. Take care my love.” Enna and Mankato held hands for a second longer and then took their positions. The ivory moon slowly ascended into ebony sky. The marsh grew dark and fog lazily rose from the ground. Harsh and blood chilling howls began to fill the air.
 Yram was the first to spot the scarlet-eyed monstrosity that began to slowly circle the ring of stone that was warding against the evils of the hags. Its elongated muzzle held protruding fangs at least as long as Yram’s arm. Grey fur made it difficult to keep track of in the somber wasteland and fog. Mankato had taken Enna’s crossbow and now cocked it back and loaded taking aim at the monster. Argento tried to conjure a bow, but had to hide in the shadow of the hut first because of the moonlight. He shot a mystical bolt at the beast hitting it in it’s arm. With a howl to make blood turn to ice the horror charged at Argento. Mankato shot a bolt from his crossbow, striking the terrifying beast in its side, but it would not die. Blood began to spew from the wound leaving scarlet pools in its wake. From the shade Argento summoned a long boar lance and lept at the creature just as it was about to cross the stones. The boar lance’s cross piece prevented the beast from coming closer to Argento as he thrust the spear into the monster. It snapped its long fangs and slashed with fearsome claws at the courageous silver prince, but no closer did it come to him. The monster’s flaming eyes turned ashen grey as it fell dead to the mucky ground. 
    While Argento and Mankato fought the Were, Eilnryb and Yram engaged in a skirmish with the followers of Yerbua. The hags fired bows of murkwood and staves of the same, while Eilnryb dueled with her long oaken staff and Yram’s amozakoc bird clawed at the hags eyes to distract them, aiding Eilnryb. Yram’s short stature took gave her great advantage in the field as she was harder to hit, so she was able to take greater aim and vanquish the foes that would fire upon Eilnryb. An arrow flew, dark as a shadow and struck Eilnryb in her stave arm as Yram finished off the attacker. With the last hag dead, Yram rushed to Eilnryb, “Iso vorie Eilnryb?” who in turn replied with glazing eyes, “It’s just a flesh wound” and blacked out. Yram was confused, what did she say? A closer inspection revealed that Eilnryb was absolutely not ok.The arrow protruded from her flesh sticking through her right bicep. The arrow’s venom had begun to spread, Death’s black veins slowly crept from the wound expanding. Leaving the arrow, Yram picked up Eilnryb as gently as she could and raced back to the shack. The other women would know what to do.
